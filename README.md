# Java Assignment on Classes

This project demonstrates the concepts of Concrete Classes, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces in Java.

## Class Types

### Concrete Class (Dog)
- Implements all methods and can be instantiated directly.

### Abstract Class (Animal)
- Contains both implemented (`eat()`) and abstract methods (`move()`).

### Interface (SoundMaker)
- Defines method signatures for sound-related behaviors.
